## Overview

**BarterX** is a barter trading application built with **Flutter** for the frontend (cross-platform for iOS and Android) and **Firebase** for the backend. This app allows users to trade goods and services directly without using money. It simplifies the process of bartering by connecting users based on items they wish to exchange. With **Firebase**, BarterX leverages real-time features such as user authentication, item listings, messaging, and notifications.
